# maize_lesion_segmentation

MatLab code to segment maize leaf lesions from background leaf tissue.  These directories include a number of other functions that may be broadly useful (and more than one false start!).  Sample data are also provided.

Please let me know if you encounter problems.  I am planning to port this code to OpenCV in 2019 and would appreciate any heads-ups you can provide.
