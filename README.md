# maize_lesion_segmentation

MatLab code to segment maize leaf lesions from background leaf tissue.  These directories include a number of other functions that may be broadly useful (and more than one false start!).  Sample data are also provided.

Please let me know if you encounter problems.  Chimdi Walter Ndubuisi is now extending and improving this code and porting to Python.
